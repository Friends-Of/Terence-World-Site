# Situational Fit

These roles can be a good match depending on scope, team structure, and expectations.

Fit improves when there is room to influence systems rather than operate within fixed ones.

## Role types

- Product or program leadership roles with a strong brand or experience component
- Marketing leadership roles that include operational or cultural responsibility
- Innovation, research, or incubation roles inside larger organizations
- Consulting or advisory roles with clear problem framing and authority boundaries

## Conditions that improve fit

- Clear mandate to shape process, not just outcomes
- Access to decision-makers and context
- Willingness to work iteratively rather than through rigid plans
- Recognition that not all value is immediately measurable

## Conditions that reduce fit

- Highly siloed responsibilities
- Output measured primarily through vanity metrics
- Environments optimized for speed over clarity
- Roles where strategy is disconnected from execution

These roles can work when expectations are aligned.
They become frustrating when judgment is constrained.
