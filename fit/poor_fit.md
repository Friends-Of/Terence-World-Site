# Poor Fit

These roles are unlikely to be a good match, even if they appear adjacent on paper.

This is not a value judgment.
It is an alignment assessment.

## Role types

- Pure execution-only roles with no strategic input
- Highly siloed individual contributor positions
- Roles optimized primarily for scale, growth hacks, or velocity
- Positions where creative work is treated as surface-level decoration

## Environment characteristics

- Strict top-down control with little room for judgment
- Decisions driven primarily by short-term metrics
- Little tolerance for ambiguity or iteration
- Culture treated as a side effect rather than a system

## Why this matters

In these contexts, my strengths are underutilized and friction increases.

I tend to do my best work where:
- Systems can be shaped
- Tradeoffs can be discussed openly
- Context is shared rather than withheld

Avoiding poor fit is as important as finding strong fit.
