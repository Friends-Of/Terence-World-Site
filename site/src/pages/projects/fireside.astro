    <h1>Fireside</h1>
    <p>In-person creative technology practice and research environment.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Fireside is a physical room for work that needs focus, conversation, and
      real tools on the table. It is not a studio for volume output; it is a
      place for decisions that shape product and system direction.
    </p>

    <h2>Decisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In-person only, by invitation or scheduled sessions.</li>
      <li>Small group size to keep accountability and clarity.</li>
      <li>Work is anchored in artifacts: prototypes, diagrams, and test results.</li>
      <li>No speculative commitments without a concrete next action.</li>
      <li>Practice over presentation: outcomes matter more than slide decks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proof</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Operating cadence: weekly research blocks, with monthly reviews.</li>
      <li>Session outputs: written decisions, repo changes, or system maps.</li>
      <li>Artifacts archived with date and owner for traceability.</li>
      <li>Invite list and session notes exist, shared on request.</li>
    </ul>
