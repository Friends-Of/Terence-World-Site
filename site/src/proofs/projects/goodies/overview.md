# Goodies Overview

Goodies is a small retail system that blends brand, operations, and technology. It focuses on
clear inventory decisions, calm service flow, and practical tools that work in real conditions.

The project treats the shop as a living lab. Feedback from customers and staff drives small,
measured experiments that improve consistency without losing the human feel.
