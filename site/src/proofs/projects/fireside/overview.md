# Fireside Overview

Fireside is a small, in-person creative technology practice based in Portland. It is designed
for focused work that needs real tools, real constraints, and clear decisions. The room is
intentionally small to keep conversations precise and outcomes accountable.

Sessions prioritize tangible artifacts: prototypes, diagrams, tests, and written decisions.
The work is not about volume or spectacle. It is a quiet environment to translate complex
ideas into usable, durable systems.
