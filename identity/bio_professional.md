# Professional Bio

Terence Brasch is a creative strategist, operator, and systems-oriented leader based in Portland, Oregon.

He works at the intersection of brand strategy, creative technology, and community-driven practice, with a focus on translating abstract ideas into durable systems that function under real-world constraints.

Terence is the founder of Fireside Creative Technology, an in-person–first creative technology practice that designs and facilitates live sessions, experiments, and structured conversations. Fireside operates as a lightweight research and production environment, helping teams and practitioners examine emerging tools, workflows, and ideas in conditions that prioritize clarity, context, and shared understanding.

He is also the co-owner and operator of Goodies Snack Shop, a brick-and-mortar retail business where brand intent is expressed through curation, operations, and daily execution. At Goodies, Terence is responsible for brand systems, inventory systems, operational decision-making, and maintaining coherence across customer experience, staffing, and financial constraints.

Across these ventures, Terence’s role is consistent: he designs systems, defines constraints, and maintains signal over time. He is often positioned between disciplines, helping teams align creative direction, operational reality, and cultural intent without flattening any one layer.

His experience spans creative direction, community-led programming, retail operations, and cross-functional leadership. He is particularly effective in ambiguous environments where the work is still forming and clarity must be built deliberately.

Terence is exploring full-time leadership roles and selective consulting opportunities where judgment, systems thinking, and long-term coherence are valued over short-term output.
