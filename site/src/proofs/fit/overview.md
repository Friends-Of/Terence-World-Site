# Fit Overview

Fit is about alignment with pace, ownership, and clarity. I work best with small teams that
value written decisions, direct feedback, and outcomes that can be measured.

Poor fit includes high-churn environments, unclear ownership, and work that prioritizes volume
over quality. The goal is shared momentum, not just shared goals.
