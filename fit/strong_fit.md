# Strong Fit

These are roles and environments where my background, working style, and judgment consistently align.

In these contexts, I tend to add value quickly and sustainably.

## Role types

- Creative strategy or creative direction roles with real decision-making authority
- Community-led brand, cultural, or experiential roles
- Cross-disciplinary leadership roles bridging creative, technical, and operational teams
- Early-stage or evolving teams where systems are still forming
- Roles that involve shaping structure, not just executing within it

## Environment characteristics

- Ambiguity is expected and tolerated
- Judgment matters as much as output
- Constraints are real and acknowledged
- Collaboration across disciplines is required
- Long-term coherence is valued over short-term wins

## Why this fits

My work at Fireside demonstrates how I design environments for learning, sense-making, and alignment under uncertainty.

My work at Goodies demonstrates how I operate systems under real economic and operational pressure.

Together, these experiences map well to roles that require:
- Clear thinking under constraint
- Systems design rather than task execution
- Stewardship of culture alongside delivery
