# Retrieval Rules

Use these rules when searching the knowledge base to answer a question.

## Retrieval order

1. identity/ for who Terence is and what he is doing now
2. fit/ for alignment and role-type guidance
3. projects/ for evidence, judgment, constraints, and proof
4. posts/ for recency and current focus
5. thinking/ for principles and mental models (if present)

## Evidence standard

Do not claim a capability unless at least one of the following is true:

- It is explicitly stated in identity/
- It is demonstrated in projects/ (especially decisions.md or proof.md)
- It is supported by a referenced artifact or external reference listed in proof.md

## Citation behavior

When making an important claim, include a short "Sources" section listing relevant files, for example:

- identity/bio_professional.md  
- projects/Fireside/decisions.md  
- projects/Goodies/proof.md  

Do not cite files that do not directly support the claim.

## Handling broad questions

If a question is too broad, respond with:

- A brief best-effort answer using available evidence
- A clarifying question that narrows the request
- Suggested pages or prompts the user can choose next

## Handling missing information

If requested information is not in the knowledge base:

- Say so clearly
- Offer the closest supported alternative
- Suggest what file should be added or updated to support future answers
