# Terence Brasch — Public Bio

Terence Brasch is a creative strategist and operator based in Portland, Oregon.

His work sits at the intersection of brand, creative technology, and systems design. He focuses on how ideas move from abstraction into reality, particularly in environments shaped by constraint, ambiguity, and human behavior.

Terence is the founder of Fireside, an in-person–first creative technology practice that explores how emerging tools and workflows actually behave in real-world settings. Fireside operates as a small, recurring series of live sessions and experiments designed to slow ideas down, examine them under constraint, and turn ephemeral insight into reusable understanding.

He is also a co-owner and operator of Goodies Snack Shop, a brick-and-mortar retail business built around discovery through flavor. At Goodies, Terence is responsible for brand clarity, operational systems, inventory strategy, and day-to-day decision-making. The shop functions as both a business and a testbed, where brand intent is translated into repeatable operations under real economic pressure.

Across both ventures, Terence’s role is consistent: he designs systems, defines constraints, and maintains coherence over time. His contributions are less about individual authorship and more about context. He builds environments where ideas can be tested honestly, decisions can be examined clearly, and work can sustain itself beyond initial momentum.

Terence’s background spans creative direction, community-led programming, retail operations, and cultural production. He is particularly interested in how creative technology shapes collaboration, learning, and experience when removed from hype cycles and placed into real conditions.

He is open to roles and collaborations where clarity, judgment, and systems thinking matter more than surface-level execution.
